dbgenerator.bat - A batch script for generating the database.

Minipos.bat - A batch script to start the Minipos application and previously used to call ngrokconnect.bat and minipos_start.bat.

minipos_start.bat (Deprecated) - An alternative script to launch Minipos. Since ngrokconnect.bat is no longer in use, this script has become redundant. However, it is retained for documentation purposes in case future changes to the Python Ngrok module necessitate reverting to previous methods.

ngrok.vbs (Deprecated) - A VBScript for establishing a console less Ngrok tunnel (no longer in use).

ngrokconnect.bat (Deprecated) - A batch script previously used to connect to Ngrok (replaced by the Python Ngrok module).
